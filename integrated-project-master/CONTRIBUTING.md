A few guidelines for someone looking to contribute here:

## If you're a beginner
* `Fork` this repository.
* `Clone` your fork on local machine.
* Switch to the `dev` branch.
* Make a new `branch`, preferably with the feature name.
* Checkout to the new branch with `git checkout <new_branch_name>`
* Do the desired changes and `commit` them with `git commit -m '<a nice commit message here>'`.
* `push` the change to your fork on GitHub with `git push origin <your_branch_name>`
* Make a `Pull Request` to the dev branch in the original repository, i.e. this one.

<b>Note: If you're looking to work on an issue, just make sure that no one else has taken it already. In which case, you can look up other issues or create a new one if you find something missing! ;) </b>

Some guidelines related to the code:

- Try to stick to the syntax style followed in the code. This will help everyone to understand your code.
- Make sure you put comments wherever necessary.
- Include a visual preview (a screenshot or a GIF?) for any visual design changes if possible.

If you want to add a new feature, feel free to do so! :D

Happy Contributing! :v:
